HOW TO RESTORE YOUR DATA (If something goes wrong)

Your data is automatically backed up every time you open the app.
Backups are saved in the "backups" folder with date and time.

If you lose data (computer crash, mistake, etc.):

1. Close the pharmacy app completely
2. Open the "backups" folder
3. Find the most recent backup file (look at date/time in filename)
   Example: pharmacy_backup_2026-01-06_14-30-22.db
4. Copy that file
5. Go to the main app folder
6. Rename the current "pharmacy.db" to "pharmacy_old.db" (or delete it)
7. Paste the backup file and rename it to exactly: pharmacy.db
8. Open the app again — all your data is back!

Your medicines, sales, expenditure — everything restored!
